## 1. Create a `requirements.txt` file

In your project folder (where you have `processing.py`), create a file called **`requirements.txt`** with the following content:

```txt
nba_api
numpy<2
bottleneck
openpyxl
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
```

This way, all dependencies are centralized.

Then install everything in your VS Code terminal with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `pip` isnâ€™t recognized, use `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.)*
=> this works
---

## 2. Clean `processing.py`

Remove all `!pip install ...` lines (they only work in Jupyter/Colab).
Hereâ€™s a cleaned version of the top of your file:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""NBA GM Tool"""

from nba_api.stats.static import teams, players
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import (
    commonteamroster,
    playercareerstats,
    leaguedashplayerstats,
)
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Example: Load all NBA teams
nba_teams = teams.get_teams()
df_teams = pd.DataFrame(nba_teams)
print(df_teams.head())

# Example: Load player stats for 2024-25 season
df_players = leaguedashplayerstats.LeagueDashPlayerStats(season='2024-25').get_data_frames()[0]
print(df_players.head())
```

---

## 3. Handling Excel files

In Colab you used:

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

That wonâ€™t work in VS Code.
Instead, just load from local Excel files in the project folder:

```python
df_western_conf_standing = pd.read_excel("western_conf_standing.xlsx")
df_eastern_conf_standing = pd.read_excel("eastern_conf_standing.xlsx")
```

So put all the Excel files you need in the same folder as `processing.py`.

---

## 4. Run the script

From VS Code terminal:

```bash
python processing.py
```

If you want autoâ€‘reload (like Colab), we can set up **Streamlit** later â€” you already mentioned you want that.

---

âš¡ Question for you:
ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **directly rewrite your whole `processing.py` into a VS Codeâ€‘ready version** (no Colab stuff, everything clean with local file loading), or do you prefer we first just test a minimal working script (NBA players DataFrame) before migrating the rest?
